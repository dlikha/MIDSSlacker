Optimal Timing for Slack Messages in MIDS Program

Background
The Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley heavily relies on electronic communication, particularly Slack, due to its online format. This study explores the optimal time to send Slack messages to course instructors in the MIDS program to enhance effective communication.
Methods
Participants: MIDS instructors across various courses.
Procedure: Instructors were randomly assigned to receive identical Slack messages either during work hours (Mon-Fri, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) or outside work hours (Mon-Fri, 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. PST).
Outcome Measure: Primary measure was the response time, defined as the duration between sending the message and receiving any response.
Experiment Design: The experiment involved sending four different messages, each repeated four times, to assess the influence of message type on response time.
Results
Response Rate: Average response rate within a 48-hour window was 55% (ranging from 52-60%).
Regression Analysis: Messages sent within working hours significantly reduced response time by an average of 4 hours (p<0.05).
Individual Message Analysis: A significant decrease in response time by 5 hours was noted for message 1.
F-Test: Confirmed the superiority of the message 1 model in reducing response time.
Additional Observations: The instructor's course type (foundational or otherwise) did not significantly affect response times.
Conclusions
Recommendation: Students are advised to send messages during working hours, especially for straightforward inquiries.
Further Research: To definitively answer the study question, a larger sample size and more comprehensive demographic data collection are necessary in future experiments.
